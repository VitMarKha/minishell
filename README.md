# minishell

## Description

With a partner, we wrote a simple shell.

In this project, we use some functions from [my libft library](https://github.com/VitMarKha/libft), as well as some functions we modify.

The compilation was performed as follows: ``gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror``.

All files pass to ``Norminette``.

No memory leaks.
